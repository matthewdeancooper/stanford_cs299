# CS229 Fall 2018 Problem Sets


## Explanation

1. In the spirit of the Stanford honour code, full solutions are not provided in
   this repository. Rather, written problem *solutions* will contain important
   observations to sketch the right direction -the rest is just algebra.
2. Working examples of each coding problem and their respective outputs will be included.
