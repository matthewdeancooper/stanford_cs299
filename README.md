## Explanation

1. In the spirit of the Stanford honour code, full solutions are not provided in
   this repository. Rather, *solutions* to written problems will contain important
   observations which sketch the right direction - the rest is *just* algebra.
   Therefore, this repository is designed to serve as a blueprint cf. a walk-through. Why?

2. Working examples of each coding problem and their respective outputs are
   included. 

3. Where GitHub size limits permit, datasets have been included in the
   repository. However, this is not the case for the missing
   `stanford_cs229/ps4/data` directory.

4. The official setup requires Miniconda to be installed to initialise the
   `environment.yml` environment. However, if you're not officially
   submitting code then I recommend keeping it simple (for Linux) with pip, and
   venv.
